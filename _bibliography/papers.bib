        <p>The main risk-limiting ballot polling audit in use today, BRAVO, is designed for
        use when single ballots are drawn at random and a decision regarding whether to stop the
            audit or draw another ballot is taken after each ballot draw (ballot-by-ballot (B2)
                    audits). On the other hand, real ballot polling audits draw many ballots in a
            single round before determining whether to stop (round-by-round (R2) audits). We show
            that BRAVO results in significant inefficiency when directly applied to real R2
            audits. We present the ATHENA class of R2 stopping rules, which we show are
            risk-limiting if the round schedule is pre-determined (before the audit begins). We
            prove that each rule is at least as efficient as the corresponding BRAVO stopping
            rule applied at the end of the round. We have open-source software libraries
            implementing most of our results.</p>

            <p>We show that ATHENA halves the number of ballots required, for all state margins
            in the 2016 US Presidential election and a first round with 90% stopping probability,
        when compared to BRAVO (stopping rule applied at the end of the round). We present
            simulation results supporting the 90% stopping probability claims and our claims for
            the risk accrued in the first round. Further, ATHENA reduces the number of ballots by
            more than a quarter for low margins, when compared to the BRAVO stopping rule applied
            on ballots in selection order. This implies that keeping track of the order when
            drawing ballots R2 is not beneficial, because ATHENA is more efficient even without
            information on selection order. These results are significant because current
            approaches to real ballot polling election audits use the B2 BRAVO rules, requiring
            about twice as much work on the part of election officials. Applying the rules in
            selection order requires fewer ballots, but keeping track of the order, and entering
            it into audit software, adds to the effort.</p>

        <p>Evidence-based elections aim to produce trustworthy and compelling evidence of the
            correctness of election outcomes, enabling the detection of problems with high
            probability. They require a well-curated voter-verified paper trail, compliance
            audits, and a rigorous tabulation audit of the election outcome, known as a
            risk-limiting audit (RLA).</p>

         <p>This paper focuses on ballot polling RLAs which can require that a very large sample
         of ballots be drawn. The main ballot polling RLA in use today, BRAVO, is designed for
         use when single ballots are drawn at random and a decision regarding whether to stop the
         audit or draw another ballot is taken after each ballot draw. But in practice, ballot
         polling audits draw many ballots in a single round before determining whether to
         stop.</p>

         <p>Direct application of BRAVO to large rounds results in considerable inefficiency. We
         present MINERVA, a risk-limiting audit that addresses this problem. When compared to the
         BRAVO stopping rule being applied at the end of the round, for a first-round with 90%
         stopping probability, MINERVA halves the number of ballots required across all state
         margins in the 2020 US Presidential election. When compared to the BRAVO stopping rule
         being applied after examination of individual ballots, MINERVA reduces the number of
         ballots by about a quarter. MINERVA requires that round sizes are predetermined; this
         does not appear to be a drawback for large first rounds which have been typical choices
         for election officials.</p>

           <p>Ballot-polling audits are the leading option in most states. MINERVA significantly
               reduces the necessary expense for contests with close margins and thus makes
               adopting RLAs easier. Wider adoption of RLAs is a critical step in increasing
               public confidence in elections.</p>

           <p>MINERVA was used in Ohio's pilot RLA of the primaries in May 2020 in Montgomery
           County. We provide open-source implementations of MINERVA. The code has been
           integrated as an option in Arlo, the most widely-used RLA software.</p>

        <p>In this paper we present simulation results comparing the risk, stopping probability,
        and number of ballots required over multiple rounds of ballot polling risk-limiting
            audits (RLAs) Minerva, Selection-Ordered (SO) Bravo, and End-of-Round (EoR) Bravo .
            Bravo is the most commonly used ballot polling RLA and requires the smallest expected
            number of ballots when ballots are drawn one at a time and the (true) underlying
            election is as announced. In real audits, multiple ballots are drawn at a time, and
            Bravo is implemented as SO Bravo or EoR Bravo.</p>
        <p>Minerva is a recently proposed ballot polling RLA that requires fewer ballots than
            either implementation of Bravo in a first round with stopping probability 0.9 but
            requires a predetermined round schedule. It is an open question how these audits
            compare over multiple rounds and for lower stopping probabilities. Our simulations
            use stopping probabilities of 0.9 and 0.25. The results are consistent with
            predictions of the R2B2 open-source library for ballot polling audits. We observe
            that both Bravo audits are more conservative than Minerva, which stops with fewer
            ballots, for both first round stopping probabilities. However, the advantage of using
            Minerva decreases considerably for the smaller first round stopping probability, as
            one would expect.</p>},
