My name is Sarah. I am a Software Engineer and CS Researcher.

I earned my B.S. in Computer Science from The George Washington University. During my time as an undergraduate I
worked as a Research Assistant for Professor Poorvi Vora and contributed to several publications on
risk-limiting audits to statistically verify election outcomes. I also served as a Teaching
Assistant in the Computer Science Department and taught for the Computer Architecture, Systems
Programming, and Discrete Structures courses.

After graduating from GW, I joined Oracle as a Software Engineer on the File System Storage team of Oracle Cloud Infrastructure (OCI)
where I was later promoted to Member of Technical Staff. As a developer on the data-plane I was
given the opportunity to tackle many complex problems in distributed storage such as introducing
support for SMB protocol and building a user quota enforcement system.

I recently left my role at Oracle to return to academia and pursue a PhD in computer science. More
on that in [this blog post](/blog/2024/i-quit). My research interests are (very broadly) distributed storage,
distributed protocols, and the intersection of theory and real-time operating systems.

I live in San Francisco with my partner, Gus, and our cats, Zuko (yes, as in Avatar: The Last
Airbender) and Kiwi. In my free time I enjoy cooking, knitting/crocheting, and playing Go. Although I
have quite a few hobbies, there is nothing I enjoy more than learning and solving problems.
