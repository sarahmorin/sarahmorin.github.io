My name is Sarah. I am a CS Researcher and (former) Software Engineer.

#### Research

My research interests lie (broadly) at the intersection of theory and systems. I believe we can improve the security, reliability, and performance of distributed systems using formal methods. These days, Iâ€™m fascinated by formal verification, high-level programming languages, and consensus protocols. Through my work, I hope to bridge the gap between powerful theoretical results and practical designs.

Currently, I am collaborating with Prof. Gabe Parmer (George Washington University) to develop a low-level, systems optimized Datalog variant. The language will enable the declarative specification of low-level systems code and the compiler (built in Rust) will produce efficient, executable implementations.

#### Background

I earned my B.S. in Computer Science from The George Washington University. During my time as an undergraduate I
worked as a Research Assistant for Professor Poorvi Vora and contributed to several publications on
risk-limiting audits to statistically verify election outcomes. I also served as a Teaching
Assistant in the Computer Science Department and taught for the Computer Architecture, Systems
Programming, and Discrete Structures courses.

After graduating from GW, I joined Oracle as a Software Engineer on the File System Storage team of Oracle Cloud Infrastructure (OCI)
where I was later promoted to Member of Technical Staff. As a developer on the data-plane I was
given the opportunity to tackle many complex problems in distributed storage such as introducing
support for SMB protocol and building a user quota enforcement system. I recently left my role at
Oracle to return to academia and pursue a PhD in computer science. More on that in [this blog post](/blog/2024/i-quit).

I live in San Francisco with my partner, Gus, and our cats, Zuko (yes, as in Avatar: The Last Airbender)
and Kiwi. In my free time, I enjoy cooking, knitting, playing pool, and watching hockey. Although I
have quite a few hobbies, there is nothing I enjoy more than learning and solving problems.
