My name is Sarah. I am a Software Engineer and CS Researcher.

I earned my B.S. in Computer Science from The George Washington University. During my time as an undergraduate I
worked as a Research Assistant for Professor Poorvi Vora and contributed to several publications on
risk-limiting audits to statistically verify election outcomes. 

After graduating from GW, I joined Oracle as a Software Engineer on the File System Storage team of Oracle Cloud Infrastructure (OCI)
where I was later promoted to Member of Technical Staff.

I live in San Francisco with my partner, Gus, and our cats, Zuko (yes, as in Avatar: The Last
Airbender) and Kiwi. In my free time I enjoy cooking, knitting/crocheting, and strength training. Although I
have quite a few hobbies, there is nothing I enjoy more than learning and solving problems.
